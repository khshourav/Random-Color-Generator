Built on simple idea of 
(1) clicking button to change background color, then escalated to 

(2) generating random rgb and hex color code to change the bacground, 

(3) copy the color codeds by clicking button

(4) Auto generating color codes with a toggle Switch

(5) When clicking on a color button or generating color, the code with respective background color will apear in a card in the right side of the screen. If the card is clicked, the bg would change and the code can be copied

Future propects for the project: 

1. Add a notepad where copied codes will appear
2. system to save certain colors
3. giving the fixed text gradient color so they dont seem invisible with certain bg
